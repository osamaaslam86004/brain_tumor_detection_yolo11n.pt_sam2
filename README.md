# Brain Tumor Detection YOLOv11

This repository contains training and segmentation results for brain tumor detection using YOLOv11.

## Folder Descriptions

### 1. `original_dataset_100_epochs`
This folder contains the training and segmentation results for the **original dataset without any data augmentation**.

You can explore the folder here:  
[original_dataset_100_epochs](https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/brain_tumor_detection_yolo11n.pt_sam2/tree/main/original_dataset_100_epochs)

### 2. `orignal_dataset_polygon_to_bounding_box`
This folder contains training and segmentation results **without data augmentation**, but with polygon annotations converted to bounding boxes.

The conversion from polygon annotations to bounding boxes was performed using the script:  
[`polygon_to_box.py`](https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/brain_tumor_detection_yolo11n.pt_sam2/blob/main/orignal_dataset_polygon_to_bounding_box/polygon_to_box.py)
